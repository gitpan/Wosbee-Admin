Wosbee::Admin


This module provides a management interface for Wosbee.com and
possibly other hosted web shop services running the Smilehouse
Workspace e-commerce software (tested with version 1.13). 

This module is mostly useful for the users of free-of-charge Wosbee 
service. If you need - and you most certainly will when your business
grows - anything more powerful, you'd be better off paying for
the enterprise hosting plan or running your own licensed copy
of the Workspace software with all the fancy integration features.
(Unless you decide to migrate to a free/libre e-commerce solution.)

The purpose of this module is just to make some simple day to day
tasks, such as uploading style sheet files or generating inventory
statements, little less painful.

**Please note that this software is written by a third party and is NOT 
SUPPORTED by Smilehouse.** This software does not use any public APIs. 
Instead it emulates a human ("scraping"), and thus it WILL break when
Wosbee changes it's web interface. There is NO WARRANTY, to the
extent permitted by law.
